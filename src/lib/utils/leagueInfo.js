  <p>Welcome to the That Time of The Year Again Dynasty Fantasy Football League Page!</p>
  <p>Founded in 2014, the League began as friendly league amongst a small group of friends. In 2021, the league converted into a full-fledged dynasty league. Each year, the managers compete to win the Championship Trophy and avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. While some managers fled from injuries and down years, others bought the dip and built for the future.</p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending annoying texts to the rest of the league for the next year, the champion manager also walks away with $900 and the last place manager hands over the Championship Trophy to the new champion.</p>
  <p>Best of luck to everyone!</p>
